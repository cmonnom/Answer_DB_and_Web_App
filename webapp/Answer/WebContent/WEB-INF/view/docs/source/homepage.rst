The homepage lists all available cases divided in 3 categories:

**My Cases**: cases that you are assigned to. You can work on a case or a report (if a report is ready).

**All Cases**: all cases, regardless of who is assigned. You can change who should work on a case, view a case (read only mode) or open a report (if a report is ready).
You can also assign groups to a case (admins only)

**Ready for Epic**: if a report for a case has been finalized (progress level 4), the case will be displayed in this table. You can print finalized reports there.

This page should be your hub for assigning users to cases, see progress and see what needs to be done.
