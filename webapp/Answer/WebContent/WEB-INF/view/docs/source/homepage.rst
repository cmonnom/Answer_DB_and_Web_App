|homeIcon| Home / Worklists
===========================

The homepage lists all available cases divided in 3 categories:

**My Cases**: cases that you are assigned to. You can work on a case or a report (if a report is ready).

**All Cases**: all cases, regardless of who is assigned. You can change who should work on a case, view a case (read only mode) or open a report (if a report is ready).
You can also assign groups to a case (admins only)

**Cases Finalized**: if a report for a case has been finalized (progress level 4), the case will be displayed in this table. You can print finalized reports.
